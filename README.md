# VGA-Controller-For-16-Bit-Processor-Architecture-Altera-
To realize the VHDL description of a VGA controller to be implemented as a peripheral in a microprocessor bus architecture. This will involve the VHDL design of the VGA controller, it's implementation on the existing VHDL bus architecture, and the development of the necessary control code to utilize the controller.
